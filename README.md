# p9p_acme_scripts
Code navigation/formatting scripts for p9p acme

These are designed to be run under a git repo, since that's what I'm interacting with 99% of the time (for better or worse).

* a+ - indent
* a- - deindent
* gt - go to (C) function definition
* gh - go to (C) function prototype (only searches headers)
* gr - search for "thing"
* pygt - go to (python) function or class definition
* f - find file, plumb if only 1 file found
* fixws - fix trailing whitespace, convert tabs to spaces, and remove carriage returns
